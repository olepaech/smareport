#' Extract and standardize month-year labels from survey question names
#'
#' This function extracts a full month-year (e.g., "January 2023") from a character string
#' and replaces it with its abbreviated form (e.g., "Jan 2023"). If no date is found, it returns
#' "Long-Run" if the string suggests a long-term horizon, or "Other" otherwise.
#'
#' @param question A character vector containing question labels.
#'
#' @return A character vector with standardized labels.
